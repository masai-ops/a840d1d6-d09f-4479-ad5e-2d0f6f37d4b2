## Description

### Getting Started

3. navigate inside the clone repository folder and run following command.
   - `npm install` - To install the dependencies
   - `npm start` - To Start running the application.

### Create a 2 Player Game where the player to reach 10 wins.

### Game Rules:
* It's a 2 Player Mini Game
* The game will have a counter with initital value zero.
* Each player will have alternate turns.
* In each turn player will have a choice to increment the counter by either 1 or 2.
* Player to reach 10 wins.
* Player 1 will go first by default.

### Example of a Game
* Counter : 0
* Player 1 : Counter + 1 => 1
* Player 2 : Counter + 2 => 3
* Player 1: Counter + 2 => 5
* Player 2: Counter + 1 => 6

### Tasks / Functionalities to Implement
1. The app will have a counter with initital value set to `0`
2. The app will also have a container that displays which player's turn it is. 
    * It will display either `Player 1` or `Player 2`. 
    * By default `Player 1` should go first.
3. The app will have two buttons to increment the counter. 
    * One button will increment the counter by 1 (+1 button). 
    * The other will increment the counter by 2 (+2 button).
    * Player in each turn can chose to increment the counter by either 1 or 2.
4. As each player will have alternate turns, each time the incement buttons are clicked, player turn should change. 
5. When counter value is 9 the +2 button should be disabled and when theres a winner (counter value is 10) the +1 button should also be disabled.
6. The app will also have one `winner-container` that displays the winner when counter reaches 10. 
    * The `winner-container` should display `Still To Be Decided` by default. 
    * When counter reaches 10 it should display either `Player 1` or `Player 2` 
7. The app will have a reset game button. 
    * This button will reset all values to default and reset the game. 

**Note** 
- Make sure you use only the given components and dont create new Components, files, folders of your own. Changing component name, file/folder structures might result in giving you zero marks
- Do Not Remove `data-testid="xxxx"` from anywhere, these are used by testing tools to test your code, removal of this will lead to low score.
- Also make sure to cross check all the spellings and Case of Texts. for example, if you write `player_1`,`PLAYER 1` or `Player One` instead of `Player 1` you will not get any marks.
